## 🧠 Why protecting {{ Resource }} matters

<!--
Assume the critical role of {{ Resource }} is already known or covered in the technology_description.

Focus this section on the *risks and consequences* of leaving {{ Resource }} unprotected.
Mention scenarios like silent corruption, accidental deletion, compliance failure, ransomware access, or operational downtime.
The goal is to justify the need for added protection, not to reintroduce the resource.
SEO goal: capture queries like “{{ Resource }} backup risks”, “protecting {{ Resource }} data”, “immutable backups for {{ Resource }}”.

If {{ Resource }} is under a shared responsability model contract, let's explain to user that it's their responsability to make their backups from a contractual standpoint.

-->

## 🔓 What happens when {{ Resource }} ...

<!--
Use this section to describe the most realistic and high-impact failure scenario for {{ Resource }}.

Examples:
- MinIO → ...is accessed with leaked credentials
- PostgreSQL → ...gets corrupted by a bad migration
- NFS → ...is mounted and wiped by mistake
- Kubernetes → ...loses state due to a node failure
- Proxmox → ...has no external snapshot and the VM fails

Write 2–3 sentences explaining what typically goes wrong, and why native protection is insufficient.

Then list how Plakar addresses this exact risk:
- Immutable, encrypted snapshots
- Externalized storage (air-gap or access isolation)
- Granular recovery without full restore

SEO goal: attract queries like “{{ Resource }} failure recovery”, “accidental deletion in {{ Resource }}”, “backup strategy for {{ Resource }}”.
-->

## 🛡️ How Plakar secures your {{ Resource }} workflows

<!--
Explain how Plakar integrates with {{ Resource }}:
- As a source to back up data from {{ Resource }}
- As a backend to store snapshots from other systems
- As a restore destination for verified snapshots

Clarify what Plakar adds: encryption, deduplication, versioning, snapshot browsing, offline usage.
SEO goal: emphasize “{{ Resource }} backup with Plakar”, “restore {{ Resource }} data”, etc.
Avoid low-value repetition; show what’s unique.
-->


## 🧰 Everything in one tool: backup, verify, restore, browse

Summarize Plakar’s value proposition as an all-in-one platform.
Highlight key capabilities:
- Immutable snapshots

Position Plakar as a single, transparent, and efficient solution for all workflows involving {{ Resource }}.
SEO goal: centralize feature keywords while staying concrete and benefits-focused.
